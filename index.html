            <blockquote>What do you do when your best friend shacks up with your ex girlfriend? You make Fajitas!</blockquote>
            <p class="mainpara" id="startpara">Chicken fajitas are an easy and flavorful weeknight meal. A classic Mexican recipe, juicy chicken is seasoned, seared and cooked to perfection, then tossed with sauteed bell peppers and onions. A squeeze of fresh lime adds a punch of flavor and the chicken fajitas are served with warm tortillas and toppings. You can't beat this healthy family favorite recipe. Nor the pretentious language.</p>
            <p class="mainpara">Don't you just love meals that only require a few basic ingredients? Well this chicken fajita recipe is just that. All you need is chicken, bell pepper, onion, lime juice and spices, plus tortillas and your favorite toppings. It's incredibly easy.</p>
            <p class="mainpara">It's a one-pan recipe and in less than 30 minutes, you'll have a tasty meal (I can't get enough of those Mexican spices) that also makes for the best leftovers or meal prep.</p>
            <h3 class="subhead">Homemade Fajita seasoning is best</h3>
            <p class="mainpara" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">While you can buy pre-made seasoning packets, I'd caution against it. Nothing compares to the flavor of homemade fajita seasoning and it's easy to whip up. Plus, you'll avoid any unnecessary fillers and additives. Here's a quick rundown of the spices you'll need:     <a href="">...continue reading</a>

                    <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-weight: lighter; font-style: italic; display:inline-block">Architect Ted Mosby enjoying a Thanksgiving dinner with his friends and the Turturkeykey</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="minorpara" id="startpara">It's a typical New York apartment, except it's 2010 and Apple has just launched the iPhone 4. Thanksgiving is upon us and so is the burden of hanging out with friends in a physical space because, you know, we aren't addicted to out phones yet.</p>
                <p class="minorpara">32 year-old Ted <i>Evelyn</i> Mosby lives with his straight friend Marshall Eriksen in a two-bedroom apartment above a bar called Maclaren's. Ted has refused to do an interview citing the reason that he wishes he didn't tell me his middle name and wishes me luck in my future endeavours. Thanks Evelyn. </p>
                <p class="minorpara">Fortunately, Marshall was more than willing to spill the beans about Ted and his peculiar invention.</p>
                <p class="minorpara">The idea for the Turturkeykey came to Ted while he was splitting a sandwich with his friends, which I highly suspect actually means passing around a big, fat blunt. Essentially a small turkey inside a bigger turkey, the Turturkeykey is just a regular turkey stuffed with turkey. Capiche?</p>
                <!--<p class="minorpara">Interestingly, Ted has been looking for ideas to impress the lead anchor for World Wide News, Robin Scherbatsky, for quite a while now. This could clearly be another attempt to get into Miss Scherbatsky's radar.</p>-->
                <p class="minorpara">However, in a shocking revelation, Marshall claims that the infamous Thanksgiving dish was not actually the brainchild of any culinary genius, but rather the result of one man's bizarre and misguided attempts at impressing a woman.</p>
                <p class="minorpara">According to him,  the idea for the turturkeykey was born out of his desperate desire to impress his love interest, Robin Scherbatsky, with his culinary skills. Apparently, Ted had no clue how to cook a turkey and was frantically searching for a solution when he stumbled upon the idea of stuffing a turkey inside a larger bird - a turkey stuffed with a smaller turkey.</p>
                <p class="minorpara">The monstrosity of a dish was dubbed the turturkeykey and was met with disgust from Ted's friends, who were forced to endure the ghastly meal. But perhaps the most damning indictment of Ted's creation was the fact that even Robin, the intended recipient of his romantic gesture, was left feeling nauseated and disappointed.</p>
                <p class="minorpara">The revelation has sparked widespread debate and controversy, with many calling for the turturkeykey to be banned altogether. PETA has also condemned the dish, stating that it is cruel and unnecessary to stuff multiple animals inside of each other for the sake of entertainment.</p>
                <p class="minorpara">Despite the backlash, it seems that the turturkeykey is here to stay, with many still eager to try their hand at creating their own version of the infamous dish. Only time will tell if Ted's creation will continue to be a Thanksgiving tradition or if it will eventually fade into obscurity.</p>
