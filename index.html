            <blockquote>What do you do when your best friend shacks up with your ex girlfriend? You make Fajitas!</blockquote>
            <p class="mainpara" id="startpara" id="mainparawidth">Chicken fajitas are an easy and flavorful weeknight meal. A classic Mexican recipe, juicy chicken is seasoned, seared and cooked to perfection, then tossed with sauteed bell peppers and onions. A squeeze of fresh lime adds a punch of flavor and the chicken fajitas are served with warm tortillas and toppings. You can't beat this healthy family favorite recipe. Nor the pretentious language.</p>
            <p class="mainpara" id="mainparawidth">Don't you just love meals that only require a few basic ingredients? Well this chicken fajita recipe is just that. All you need is chicken, bell pepper, onion, lime juice and spices, plus tortillas and your favorite toppings. It's incredibly easy.</p>
            <p class="mainpara" id="mainparawidth">It's a one-pan recipe and in less than 30 minutes, you'll have a tasty meal (I can't get enough of those Mexican spices) that also makes for the best leftovers or meal prep.</p>
            <h3>Homemade Fajita seasoning is best</h4>
            <p class="mainpara" id="mainparawidth" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">While you can buy pre-made seasoning packets, I'd caution against it. Nothing compares to the flavor of homemade fajita seasoning and it's easy to whip up. Plus, you'll avoid any unnecessary fillers and additives. Here's a quick rundown of the spices you'll need:     <a href="">...continue reading</a>

            <p class="minorpara">Allesandro's is a place where you to punish your boyfriend for talking to that girl that one time. The food is inedible swill. Every mouthful of the Risotto felt like an eternity and none of my friends could finish it, which is saying a lot because one of my friends eats books.</p>  
            <p class="minorpara">The service is laughably incompetent. One of the waiters actually carried the breadsticks in his pants!</p>

A media spokesperson currently stationed at the Ranch has been able to gain new first-hand insights from the cows.</p>
            <p class="mainpara" id="mainparawidth"><i>"It's a shame, really. We toil here all day making sure you humans get the best quality milk and this is how your repay us"</i>, one particularly large Jersey commented.</p>

I explained to him how he could weaken his eyesight if he makes this a habit, but do you think it's going to change anything while this disgusting stuff is available everywhere, espcially to underaged calves?"</i> - Vealonica, longtime resident cow of the Ranch.</p>
            <p class="mainpara" id="mainparawidth">Some of them were less subdued in their comments.</p>

                <p class="minorpara" id="startpara">It's a typical New York apartment, except it's 2010 and Apple has just launched the iPhone 4. Thanksgiving is upon us and so is the burden of hanging out with friends in a physical space because, you know, we aren't addicted to out phones yet.</p>
                <p class="minorpara">32 year-old Ted <i>Evelyn</i> Mosby lives with his straight friend Marshall in a two-bedroom apartment above a bar called Maclaren's. Ted has refused to do an interview citing the reason that he wishes he didn't tell me his middle name and wishes me luck in my future endeavours. Thanks Evelyn. </p>
                <p class="minorpara">Fortunately, I was able to get some good tidbits from Ted about how the Turturkeykey came into being.</p>
                <p class="minorpara">The idea for the Turturkeykey came to Ted while he was splitting a sandwich with his friends, which I highly suspect actually means passing around a big, fat blunt. Essentially a small turkey inside a bigger turkey, the Turturkeykey is just a regular turkey stuffed with turkey. Turkey?</p>
