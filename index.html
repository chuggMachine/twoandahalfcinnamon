            <h1>SCRUMPTIOUS CHICKEN FAJITAS</h1>

            <blockquote>What do you do when your best friend shacks up with your ex girlfriend? You make Fajitas!</blockquote>
            <p class="mainpara" id="startpara" id="mainparawidth">Chicken fajitas are an easy and flavorful weeknight meal. A classic Mexican recipe, juicy chicken is seasoned, seared and cooked to perfection, then tossed with sauteed bell peppers and onions. A squeeze of fresh lime adds a punch of flavor and the chicken fajitas are served with warm tortillas and toppings. You can't beat this healthy family favorite recipe.</p>
            <p class="mainpara" id="mainparawidth">Don't you just love meals that only require a few basic ingredients? Well this chicken fajita recipe is just that. All you need is chicken, bell pepper, onion, lime juice and spices, plus tortillas and your favorite toppings. It's incredibly easy.</p>
            <p class="mainpara" id="mainparawidth">It's a one-pan recipe and in less than 30 minutes, you'll have a tasty meal (I can't get enough of those Mexican spices) that also makes for the best leftovers or meal prep.</p>
            <h3>Homemade Fajita seasoning is best</h4>
            <p class="mainpara" id="mainparawidth">While you can buy pre-made seasoning packets, I'd caution against it. Nothing compares to the flavor of homemade fajita seasoning and it's easy to whip up. Plus, you'll avoid any unnecessary fillers and additives. Here's a quick rundown of the spices you'll need:      <a href="url">...read more</a>

            <p class="minorpara">Sure, but I'd have to order two meals - one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head.</p>

            <p class="minorpara">Allesandro's is a place where you to punish your boyfriend for talking to that girl that one time. The food is inedible swill. Every mouthful of Risotto felt like an eternity and none of my friends could finish it, which is saying a lot because one of my friends eats books.</p>  
            <p class="minorpara">The service is laughably incompetent. One of the waiters actually carried the breadsticks in his pants!</p>
