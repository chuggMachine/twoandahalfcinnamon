# Two and a Half Cinnamon
Satire food blog inspired by sitcoms

This is a project I made to wrap up my basics for HTML and CSS as I finish the foundations course on the Odin Project. I'm also showcasing my understanding of Flexbox and Grid here.

The newspaper style layout has been made with nested flex containers. I used Grids to make the layout for the featured articles section at the bottom of the page. Lastly, media queries are used to make the site responsive for mobile screens.
